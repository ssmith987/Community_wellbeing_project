Sheri's Readme

In search of how to assess healthy neighborhoods, we took one from the "playbook" of  scientists who discovered that inhabitants of Roseto, PA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseto_effect) outlived most Americans despite unhealthy diets. The research suggests that a sense of community positively impacted longevity. In search of data to support a sense of community in neighborhoods, we eliminated large chain and superstores from our Google places API search in favor of finding churches and small businesses. We felt that these types of establishments are more likely to sustain one to one relationships with locals, and therefore contribute to the above mentioned "sense of community". However, Google's  latitude and longitude parameters presented a challenge. This was solved by utilizing an api for Sandag, a San Diego government website that correlated zip codes with geographical coordinates. Combining data from the two, provided a dataset for San Diego organized by zip code, and those with the highest concentration of small businesses and churches are top rated, and those with the least, are ranked the lowest.
